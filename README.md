VCS Setup
=========

This repository has
  * the Mercurial and Git Android ignore files,
  * a Mercurial ignore file for an Android Studio wrapper project with modules (it's hard to have a Git project with submodules that are constantly modified. So Git submodules are not used).

The `setup` script
  
  * initialezes Git and Mercurial aliases,
  * copies global Git and Mercurial ignore files to the user's home directory,
  * sets Git and Mercurial user name and e-mail address.

#### How to use

Clone and run the `setup` excutable file.
