VCS Setup
=========

This repository contains scripts that
  * has the Mercurial and Git Android ignore files,
  * has a Mercurial ignore file for an Android Studio wrapper project with modules (it's hard to have a Git project with submodules that are constantly modified. So Git submodules are not used),
  * permorms Git and Mercurial aliases initialization,
  * copies global Git and Mercurial ignore files to the user's home directory,
  * set Git and Mercurial user name and e-mail address.

#### How to use

Clone and run the `setup` excutable file.
